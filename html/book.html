        <h1>Book</h1>
        <p>
          With UX research, I created a book to discuss difficult topics with
          your child.

          The Openhearted Adolescence Book is a fun and helpful guide designed
          to improve communication between parents/caregivers and teenagers. It
          covers topics like relationships, feelings of safety, sadness,
          vaping/smoking, alcohol, separation, and romantic feelings. The goal
          of the book is to create a comfortable and open environment where both
          parties can communicate positively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why this design? The concept of the Openhearted Adolescence Book
          emerged from the need to bridge the communication gap between
          parents/caregivers and teenagers, especially in times when
          communication can be challenging. Choosing a book format is based on
          the positive responses from kids and experts, seeing the book as an
          approachable and creative way to discuss sensitive topics. The book
          aims to help parents and teenagers understand each other better
          through positive and open conversations. We collaborated with experts
          like Annet Peetoom and Magrethe to ensure the book provides useful
          tips and ideas to enhance communication. The goal is to ask questions,
          initiate discussions, and bring parents and teenagers closer through
          positive and open conversations.
